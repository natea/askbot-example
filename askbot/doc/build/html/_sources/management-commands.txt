Askbot management commands
==========================

There are a number of command line utilities help the forum administrator
perform a range of tasks such as add or revoke administration privileges, back up and restore
the forum data, fix database errors if such occur, etc.

To run these commands there is a general pattern::

    cd project_directory
    python manage.py some_command [possible arguments and parameters]

I.e. the commands are generally run from the project directory (the same 
one that contains your settings.py file) and they may use additional parameters and options.

Data and User administration commands
=====================================

The bulk of the management commands fall into this group and will probably be the most frequently used.

+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| command                         | purpose                                                     |
+=================================+=============================================================+
| `add_admin <user_id>`           | Turn user into an administrator                             |
|                                 | `<user_id>` is a numeric user id of the account             |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `remove_admin <user_id>`        | Remove admin status from a user account - the opposite of   |
|                                 | the `add_admin` command                                     |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `add_askbot_user --user-name    | Create a user account. If password is not given, an         |
| --email [--password]            | unusable password will be set. Possible values for the      |
| [--email-frequency]`            | --email-frequency are: **i**, **d**, **w**, **n**           |
|                                 | that stand for                                              |
|                                 | instant, daily, weekly and never - respectively. The default|
|                                 | value is w. The command does not create associations with   |
|                                 | any of the external login providers.                        |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `dump_forum [--dump-name        | Save forum contents into a file. `--dump-name` parameter is |
| some_name]`                     | optional                                                    |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `get_tag_stats [-u|-t] [-e]`    | Print tag subscription statistics, per tag (option -t)      |
|                                 | or per user (option -u), if option -e is given, empty       |
|                                 | records will be shown too (longer versions of the options   |
|                                 | are: --per-tag-subscription-counts for -t,                  |
|                                 | --per-user-tag-subscription-counts for -u, and --print-empty|
|                                 | for -e).                                                    |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `load_forum <file_name>`        | Load forum data from a file saved by the `dump_forum`       |

+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `load_stackexchange <file.zip>` | Load SackExchange dump into Askbot. It is best to run this  |
|                                 | command on empty database. Also - before running, make sure |
|                                 | that `askbot.importers.stackexchange` is in the list of     |
|                                 | installed apps within your settings.py file (it might also  |
|                                 | be necessary to run `syncdb` command to initiate the        |
|                                 | SE importer tables).                                        |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `rename_tags --from <from_tags> | Rename, merge or split tags. User ID is the id of the user  |
| --to <to_tags> --user-id        | who will be assigned as the performer of the retag action.  |
| <user_id>`                      | If more than is in the `--from` or the `--to` parameters    |
|                                 | then that parameter quoted, e.g. `--to "tag1 tag2".         |
|                                 | If user id is not given, the administrator with the smallest|
|                                 | id number will be automatically assigned.                   |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `rename_tags_id --from          | This command is the same as `rename_tags`, but takes the tag|
| <from_tag_ids> --to             | id's as arguments.                                          |
| <to_tag_ids> --user_id          |                                                             |
| <user_id>`                      |                                                             |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `delete_unused_tags`            | Permanently deletes tags that do not appear in any questions|
|                                 | , including the questions that are themselves               |
|                                 | marked as deleted.                                          |
+---------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

Batch jobs
==========

Batch jobs are those that should be run periodically. A program called `cron` can run these commands at the specified times (please look up futher information about `cron` elsewhere).

+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| command              | purpose                                                     |
+======================+=============================================================+
| `send_email_alerts`  | Dispatches email alerts to the users according to           |
|                      | their subscription settings. This command does not          |
|                      | send iinstant" alerts because those are sent automatically  |
|                      | and do not require a separate command.                      |
|                      | The most frequent alert setting that can be served by this  |
|                      | command is "daily", therefore running `send_email_alerts`   |
|                      | more than twice a day is not necessary.                     |
+----------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

Data repair commands
====================

Under certain circumstances (especially when using MySQL database with MyISAM 
storage engine or when venturing to adapt the software to your needs) some 
records in the database tables may become internally inconsistent. 
The commands from this section will help fix those issues.

.. note::

 Data inconsistency in the Askbot project is considered as a critical error and as a matter of 
 the project policy is addressed on the day of reporting. If you discover such issue - please
 report it at the forum or by email at `admin@askbot.org`

+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| command                        | purpose                                                     |
+================================+=============================================================+
| `add_missing_subscriptions`    | adds default values of email subscription settings to users |
|                                | that lack them                                              |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `fix_answer_counts`            | recalculates answer counts for all questions                |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `fix_inbox_counts`             | recalculates response counts in the user inboxes            |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `fix_revisionless_posts`       | adds a revision record to posts that lack them              |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `fix_question_tags`            | takes tag names from the record on the question table       |
|                                | and stores them in the tag table. This defect may show when |
|                                | the server process is interrupted after the question was    |
|                                | saved, but tags were not updated, and the symptom is that   |
|                                | the question cannot be found via the tag search.            |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+

The above commands are safe to run at any time, also they do not require 
additional parameters. In the future all these will be replaced with just one simple command.

Developer commands
==================

Besides the commands designed to help run the forum, there are several aiming to help
the developers of the Askbot project:

+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| command                        | purpose                                                     |
+================================+=============================================================+
| `make_docs`                    | Rebuild HTML documentation for the project                  |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| `jinja2_makemessages`          | Extract translatable strings into the `.po` files. Works    |
|                                | exactly the same way as the django `makemessages` command   |
|                                | but extracts strings from Jinja2 templates that are used    |
|                                | by the Askbot project. **Note:** the `jinja2_makemessages`  |
|                                | must be run from the `askbot` app directory, unlike all the |
|                                | remaining commands that are expected to be run from the     |
|                                | site root directory.                                        |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
