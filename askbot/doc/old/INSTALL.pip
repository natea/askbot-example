* Install virtualenv and pip:
    easy_install virtualenv
    easy_install pip

* Install MySQL:
    sudo apt-get install mysql-client mysql-server

* Install sphinxsearch. See:
    [optional]
    http://sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html
    http://www.hackido.com/2009/01/install-sphinx-search-on-ubuntu.html
    git://github.com/johnl/deb-sphinx-search.git

* Install a virtual environment OUTSIDE of this directory:
    pip install -E ~/env -r askbot-requirements.txt 
[there is discussion on the pinax forums about what it should be outside
the source directory]

* Notice that you will need to register with recaptcha.net and receive
    recaptcha public and private keys that need to be saved in your
    settings_local.py file

* Start your environment:
    source ~/env/bin/activate

* Install mysql-python into your virtualenv, because we can't
automagically install it with pip:
    easy_install --prefix ~/env/ mysql-python

For more information about why pip can't automatically install the
MySQL driver, see this message: http://groups.google.com/group/python-virtualenv/msg/ea988085951c92b3
